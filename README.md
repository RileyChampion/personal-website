Created on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

## Notes

 * Dabbled in some front-end web developement this summer, which led to me creating my own personal website.
 * Learned very early on how great it is to have mock-ups on hand made development a lot smoother.
 * **NOTE:** Some of the designs changed during development (ie Project cards, mobile view). 
 * Learned that CSS can be quite finicky, but the end result makes it so much nicer!
 * Looking to look more into back-end development and linking it to a database, but that's for my next project!
